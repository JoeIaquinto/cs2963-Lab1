1. Read the four criteria for Free Software
  The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
  The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
  The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).
  The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
2.  Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?
    - Write two to five sentences
    It's important to choose a license for multiple reasons. Firstly, it helps people be able to use your software.
    Licensing your software gives "permission first".
    This allows users to know ahead of time whether they have permission to distribute the software.
    The open source definition and licenses allow developers to have a common terms of use for software and IP.
3.  Why they SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license
    - Write two to five sentences.
    You shouldn't use a project that doesn't have an explicitly listed license because you won't be able to
    share your software. The owner did not give you permission to share the software because it is by default "All Rights Reserved".
4. Read the Failure to follow the Open System Model Section of [Why the Web beat Gopher](http://ils.unc.edu/callee/gopherpaper.htm#explain)
    - Do you agree with this claim? write two to five sentences.
    I can see how not following the Open System Model would damage Gopher's credibility.
    Although it seems like Gopher's overall model was just not as good as WWW's, the lack of
    licensing made it difficult for gopher to gain a following. It also turns off the open source community,
    which can be valuable as they are the people that want to work with your code.
5.  Android uses the [Apache license 2.0 and it's kernel uses GPL v2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)), [Linux uses the  GPL v2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux ) license,
Microsoft [.NET Core uses MIT license]( https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr ), SailfishOS is [not open source]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailfish_OS ).  
    - Can you justify why such a license is chosen (Justification for ONE  is enough).
    Linux uses the "GNU General Public License v2.0" because it allows Linux to release their os and
    any one can use it, with a few stipulations. You have to disclose your source code and retain the license,
    but users can modify your code and share it with other as long as they use the license too.
6.  Think of an example project. Pick a license (as a group) using the [LICENSE chooser by Github](http://choosealicense.com/).
    Suppose I made a small program of scripts to help my coworkers use their computer.
    I could publish it with an MIT license so anyone can edit it.
7.  Read these licenses  GPL, LGPL and Apache/BSD and discuss which one will be better - for a developer, for a company and for the common good - write 5 to 10 sentences. You may use [tldrlegal](https://tldrlegal.com/license/)
    For a developer:
      Developers might want to choose either the LGPL or the GPL because it allows people to take your changes and code, and modify them.
      The LGPL is for use in libraries, because other things in the library have to be LGPL, but applications that use it do not.
      The GPL is used by projects like linux because developers have to share their contributions back to the community.
    For a company:
      Companies may be more concerned with proprietary software and software patents so they might look to
      //TODO
    For the common good:
      //TODO
8.  Create a  and [choose a license](https://github.com/blog/1530-choosing-an-open-source-license)
    [License Repository](https://github.com/JoeIaquinto/cs2963-Licenses)
9.  Take 5 projects from [Observatory](http://rcos.io) - create a table which project has which license. for example:

Website | License Present | License
---------|:----------|:-------
https://github.com/rcos/Observatory | Yes | Two Clause BSD License https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license
https://github.com/kelleyb/swolemon-android | Yes | MIT Public License
https://github.com/funnymanpatrick/EveOnlineMarketAnalysisTool | Yes | GPL v3
https://github.com/aosdict/yacs | Yes | MIT Public License
https://github.com/FullScreenShenanigans/FullScreenPokemon | Yes | MIT Public License
https://github.com/TheoBr/Chrometana | Yes | MIT Public License

10.  Write five sentences about choosing a project to work in this course and  who will be users/customers  and what license will you choose.
