## Lab 4

* What I changed
  * My table changed 2 files in the FreeBSD man pages. One was the FAQ, which was missing a set of parenthesis around the FAQ acronym. The other was for the command relang which had a misspelling of especially.
* Why it is important to maintain good documentation
  * It's important to maintain good documentation because healthy documentation enables yourself and other developers to write better code and better code helps good documentation get written.
* What I learned
  * I learned more about the FreeBSD Open Source operating system and it's boundless documentation. It definitely opened my eyes a bit towards utilizing man pages and documentation more instead of just StackOverflowing my question.
